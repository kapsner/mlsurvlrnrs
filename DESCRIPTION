Description: Enhances 'mlexperiments'
    <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=mlexperiments> with additional
    machine learning ('ML') learners for survival analysis. The package
    provides R6-based survival learners for the following algorithms:
    'glmnet' <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=glmnet>, 'ranger'
    <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=ranger>, 'xgboost'
    <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xgboost>, and 'rpart'
    <https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rpart>. These can be used directly
    with the 'mlexperiments' R package.
